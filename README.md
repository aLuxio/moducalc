# moducalc

This is the skeleton of a modular calculator webapp, an idea I have been sitting on for a while now and have only recently found the motivation to start.
The files and commit messages will probably be silly as I'm using this project to teach myself JavaScript and basic web development.

As for the project itself, I want to build an all-in-one calculator that emphasizes visual representations (e.g. movement of a point charge through an electric field).
My main source of inspiration for this are synthesizer VSTs like Vital that allow the user to drag and drop certain parameters, like LFOs and envelopes, directly into parts of the oscillator and its attached effects. I'm also taking inspiration from Scratch, MIT's introductory programming tool that uses premade blocks of code that fit like a jigsaw puzzle. 
I want this app to be a valuable educational tool that hopefully sheds some light on what mathematics actually **do** and how it all interconnects. I also plan to include loads of premade functions like integrals, physics formulas, trig, etc. that can be easily accessed through blocks.

This project is a massive, looming work in progress that I intend to take on mostly alone, so I have no clue whether this will come into fruition or not. This project is daunting. However, I do want to try to make this tool as intuitive and pretty as possible.
